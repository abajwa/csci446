  	  	  		you should start with that. Reading books can really expand your mind and allow you 
  	  	  		to learn so many different skills and gain knowledge that will help you in all areas 
  	  	  		of your life. I'm not talking about fiction books here. I'm talking about business books, 
  	  	  		personal development books, or any book where you will actually learn a new skill by reading it. 

  	  	  		You can also take courses and attend seminars. Think about it. These programs are taught by people
  	  	  		who have spent decades figuring out how to make some aspect of their life work and now they are going 
  	  	  		to teach you how to do it. Of course, you want to do some research before you invest in some of these
  	  	  		seminars and make sure you're not just paying for some sales presentation. 

  	  	  		Reading, listening to audio tapes while you drive or workout, attending seminars, and doing anything
  	  	  		that will increase your knowledge and skill base are all great ways to invest your money. However,
  	  	  		before you start, you will want to make sure you have a goal in mind. You want to be clear on what you 
  	  	  		will gain out of doing all of these things. Are you looking to become a better husband or wife? Do you 
  	  	  		want to get in the best shape of your life? Do you want to be a better cook perhaps? How about becoming a writer?
